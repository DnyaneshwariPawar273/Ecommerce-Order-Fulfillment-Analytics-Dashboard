🚨 Problem Statement

The company lacked a centralized system to monitor delivery performance and delay trends across product categories and regions.
Without structured analytics:

- Delivery delays were not tracked properly
  
- Regional performance differences were unclear
  
- Average delivery time was not monitored
  
- Sales impact due to delays was not measurable
  
This project provides a dashboard-based solution to track and improve order fulfillment efficiency.
